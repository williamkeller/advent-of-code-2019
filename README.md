# Advent of Code 2019 in Node

Because I _like_ the pain. 

The goal this year is to go back and continually refactor and develop a library of sorts for working on advent
problems. I've seen people create specialized languages for such a task. I'm not nearly smart enough to do
that, so a library is the next best thing.

This means that earlier solutions may be refactored in light of new ideas in later days, and you can't really
refactor without tests, so those need to be added.
